# 👋 Hey, I'm Mamoun

I'm a Communication Systems student at EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland) with a strong interest in algorithms, real-time systems, and performance-driven software design.

I enjoy building systems where mathematical structure meets real-world constraints — latency, memory efficiency, scalability, and clean architecture.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🚄 ReCHor — Swiss Public Transport Route Search Engine
A full routing engine based on the Connection Scan Algorithm (CSA), processing real GTFS timetable data using memory-mapped binary buffers.  
Includes journey reconstruction, caching, alias resolution, and a JavaFX interface.

### 🐍 Crazy Serpent 214 — Real-Time Multiplayer Game
A server-driven multiplayer snake arena built in Scala.  
Features a 40ms tick-based simulation pipeline, collision resolution, power-ups, respawn logic, and spectator mode.

### 🎮 ICOOP — 2D Grid-Based Game Engine
A modular object-oriented game built in Java, focused on entity modeling, collision handling, and layered architecture.

## 🧠 Core Focus

- Algorithm design & complexity analysis  
- Performance-conscious implementations  
- Real-time simulation models  
- Clean abstractions & modular systems  
- Functional & object-oriented programming  

I’m particularly interested in roles combining quantitative reasoning and software engineering — including quant research, algorithmic development, and high-performance backend systems.
